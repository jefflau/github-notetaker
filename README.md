# Github Notetaker
This is my version of the Github Notetaker, which was built by following the tutorial at egghead.io, by Tyler Mcginnis. You can check that out here:

[https://egghead.io/courses/react-native-fundamentals](https://egghead.io/courses/react-native-fundamentals)

The tutorial was made a while ago, so I've made some adjustments such as using `Navigator` over `NavigatorIOS`, by following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@dabit3/react-native-navigator-navigating-like-a-pro-in-react-native-3cb1b6dc1e30#.icx11m5fb) which others may find useful

##Installation:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then open Xcode at hit run.
